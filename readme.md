Summary
=======

The source code and the datasets used for the experiments in my "Relational Aggregation using First-Order Deep Neural Models" paper to appear at AAAI-18. 

## How to run the code:

Make sure you have java JDK installed on your machine. Compile the code using the following command (note that the command starts after $):

    $ javac *.java

Then for each experiment, run the corresponding class:

    $ java <ClassName>

For instance to run the experiemnts on the Yelp! dataset, run:

    $ java YelpMC

The other classes are called `MovieLensGender`, `MovieLensAge`, and `KDD`.
